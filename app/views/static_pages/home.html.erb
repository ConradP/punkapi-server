  <p>Have you ever wanted to search through Brewdog's expansive back catalogue of beer in a programmatic way? Maybe build a tool that pairs beer with food, or search beers with an abv of more than 4%? Well now your prayers have been answered!</p>
  <p>The PunkAPI takes Brewdog's DIY Dog and turns it into a searchable, filterable API that's completely free and open source.</p>
  <p>If you spot any mistakes with the data feel free to <a href="https://github.com/samjbmason/punkapi/issues">submit an issue</a>.</p>
